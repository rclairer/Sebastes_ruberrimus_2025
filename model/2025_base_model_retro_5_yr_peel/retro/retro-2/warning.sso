Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 74  < max pop len bins: 88; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Note 2 Suggestion:  recr_dist_method 3 is simpler and takes 1 parm for each settlement
Warning 1 : Block:2 1 ends in: 2024 after retroyr+1:  2023
Warning 2 : Block:3 1 ends in: 2024 after retroyr+1:  2023
