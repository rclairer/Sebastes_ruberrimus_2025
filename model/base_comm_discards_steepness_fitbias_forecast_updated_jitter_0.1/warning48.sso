Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 74  < max pop len bins: 88; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Note 2 Suggestion:  recr_dist_method 3 is simpler and takes 1 parm for each settlement
Warning 1 : At least one block pattern ends in endyr. Check the output parameter value time series to see if the values in forecast years are as intended.
Warning 2 : Minimum pop size bin:_8; is > L at Amin for sex: 1; Gpat: 1; L= 3.21411
Warning 3 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 1.11546e-07; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Warning 4 : Final gradient: 0.000132694 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
