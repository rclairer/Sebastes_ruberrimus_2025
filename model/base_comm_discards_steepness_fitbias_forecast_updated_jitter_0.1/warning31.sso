Warning 2 : Minimum pop size bin:_8; is > L at Amin for sex: 1; Gpat: 1; L= 0.14162
Warning 3 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 1.005e-08; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
