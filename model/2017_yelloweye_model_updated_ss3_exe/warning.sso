Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 74  < max pop len bins: 88; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Note 2 Suggestion:  recr_dist_method 3 is simpler and takes 1 parm for each settlement
Warning 1 : At least one block pattern ends in endyr. Check the output parameter value time series to see if the values in forecast years are as intended.
Warning 2 : parameter init value is less than parameter min -16.1653 < -15 for parm: 9; search for <now check> in echoinput.sso for parm_type
Warning 3 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 4 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 4 : Final gradient: 0.000108338 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
 4 warnings  and 3 notes
