Warning 1 : catch is 0.0 in endyr; this can cause problem in the benchmark and forecast calculations. 
Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 74  < max pop len bins: 88; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Note 2 Suggestion:  recr_dist_method 3 is simpler and takes 1 parm for each settlement
Warning 2 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 4 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 3 : Final gradient: 0.000169042 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 2; check results, variance may be suspect
 3 warnings  and 3 notes
