# Data

<!--- Provide temporal and spatial resolutions or sample size where appropriate for each of the subsections, below.--->

A summary of available data by type and fleet used in the Yelloweye Rockfish assessment is available in @fig-data. Data that have changed from the previous 2017 assessment are summarized below. No new data sources were considered in this update assessment. 

Removals: 

- Post-2016 landings and discards were added for all three states for the commercial and recreational fleets. 
- A new Oregon historical recreational catch reconstruction was incorporated, which covered 1979 - 2000. 
- A new Washington historical recreational catch reconstruction was provided by WDFW and included changes to data from 1990-2016.

Composition Data: 

- Length and age composition data were added from 2017 - 2024 for all states for the commercial and recreational fleets. 
- Length and age composition data were also extended for the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS) and the IPHC Longline survey.
- Some length and age composition data from the 2017 assessment had minor errors in how sample numbers were calculated, ageing error assignment, and doubled age samples and thus needed to be fixed. See @sec-fd_comps below.   

Indices of Abundance: 

- Indices that were updated with more recent data and/or updated methodology include: 
    - Oregon Onboard Observer (2001 - 2024) 
    - Oregon ORBS Dockside (release only) (2004-2024)
    - WCGBTS (2003 - 2024)
    - IPHC Longline Survey (2002 - 2024)

Biological Data: 

- Length-weight relationship parameters were updated to include all the recent (2017 - 2024) fishery-independent data.
- Ageing error matrices were unchanged but some Oregon recreation ages were assigned the wrong ageing error and were corrected based on ODFW recommendations. 

## Fishery-Dependent Data 

<!-- Commercial fisheries landings by state, year, and gear (PacFIN is the standard source for recent domestic commercial landings), historical catch estimates, discards, recreational fisheries catches, foreign removals; sample size information for length- and age-composition data by state, year and gear, including both the number of trips and fish sampled. Description of methods to estimate abundance indices, sample size information by survey and year. Include complete tables and figures and date of data extraction. -->

Updated fishery-dependent data, including removals, length and age compositions, and indices of abundance, are detailed below. 

### Landings

A summary of total removals are provided in @tbl-all_removals and @fig-catch.

Recent commercial landings (2017-2024) were obtained from [PacFIN](www.pacfin.psmfc.org) for California, Oregon and Washington. For the period from 2016 through 2023, updated West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) discard estimates were added to PacFIN landings by adding the annual dead discard mortality rate for the commercial sector in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multi-year (GEMM) recorded discards to obtain the total catch of Yelloweye Rockfish within commercial fleets. 

Bycatch for the At-Sea Pacific Hake fleet (A-SHOP) was updated from 2017 through 2024.

Recreational removals from [RecFIN](www.recfin.org) were updated for California, Oregon and Washington from 2017 - 2024. RecFIN removals include an estimate of discard mortality and represent total estimated removals. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) provided updated historical recreational removals for Oregon from 1979 through 2000(@Whitman_2024). The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) provided updated historical recreational removals (1967-1989) and WDFW Ocean Sampling Program (OSP) estimates (1990-2001). The historical recreational removals for 1971, 1974, and 1979 were not available and were filled in as the average of the two preceding and two following years. Historical data were filtered to marine catch areas 1-4. For OSP catch estimates, data included marine catch areas 1-4, up to the Bonilla-Tatoosh line. WDFW also provided updated catch estimates for 2002-2004, which did not include discard mortality. To adjust for this, we multiplied the average mortality rate from the following five years (2005-2009) by the total discards to calculate total mortality for those years.  

### Fishery-Dependent Length and Age Compositions {#sec-fd_comps}

Updated length composition data for commercial catches (trawl and non-trawl) were available from PacFIN (extracted April 4, 2025) and from WCGOP for all three states. These include the years 2017 - 2024 for PacFIN data and 2017 - 2023 for WCGOP data. Updated recreational length composition data were available from RecFIN (extracted April 4, 2025) for all three states, and include years 2017 - 2024. Additionally, updated length compositions from the California On-Board CPFV Observer Sampling Program and from the Ocean Recreational Fishery Survey (ORFS, previously the Oregon onboard recreational observer program), both of which measure fish discarded at sea, were also available up through 2024 on RecFIN. 

New commercial age composition data from PacFIN and WDGCOP for 2017-2024 was included for Oregon and Washington. No new commercial age data were available from California. New recreational age composition data was available from RecFIN from 2017 - 2024 for Washington only (extracted May 13, 2025). These data were collected in the WDFW Ocean Sampling Program (OSP). There were also some historical updates to Oregon and Washington recreational age data provided by the state representatives.

In addition to extending the length data time series, we also fixed minor data errors found in the 2017 assessment. For length composition data, years with small samples sizes (N = 1) were excluded. There were no changes in how commercial length sample numbers were calculated. However, all recent recreational fleet length data were missing the total number of trips information used to calculate the number of samples. Using data from the 2017 assessment, we built fleet-specific linear regressions to approximate the relationship of samples to the number of fish. Then, we applied that regression to the total number of fish for data between 2017 and 2024 to estimate the number of samples. A future benchmark assessment should investigate how to get the number of sampled trips from RecFIN to calculate the number of samples using the @stewart_bootstrapping_2014 method.

We also found that conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) data from the 2017 assessment had all sample sizes and relative proportions doubled, potentially from when Yelloweye Rockfish was changed from a two-sex to single-sex model. For most fleets this was not a problem because the proportions of age-at-length counts were the same, however, some of the commercial fleets included discard age proportions that were not doubled, leading to small differences in proportions. To fix the CAAL data so it accurately represented the number of fish in each age class, we either rebuilt the entire fleet’s CAAL data frame using the most recently pulled information from PacFIN and RecFIN, or divided the number of samples or relative proportions in each length bin by two. How these problems were treated for each fleet specifically is detailed below, including other minor data changes. Otherwise, length and age composition data are unchanged from the previous assessment; please refer to the most recent benchmark assessment [@gertseva_stock_2017] for additional information. 

#### Fleet Specific Changes in the Compositional Data

Fleet 2. California Non-Trawl:

- For ages, all the CAAL and marginal ages (used to explore fits only, not included in the likelihood) data were recalculated using the most recent age data pulled from PacFIN and WCGOP, to account for age doubling in 2017.

Fleet 3. California Recreational:

- CAAL data for 1979-1984 were doubled, so the number of samples and age-at-length proportions were divided by two.
- CAAL data for 2009-2016 were doubled, but the raw data we received from RecFIN were correct, without doubled ages, so this time series was replaced with newly pulled data. 
- We then re-built the marginal age data from the updated CAAL for both time periods because there were errors in previous data entry and sample number calculations.

Fleet 4. Oregon/Washington Trawl & Fleet 5. Oregon/Washington Non-Trawl:

- Both the OR/WA commercial fleets had all CAAL and marginal age (not included in the likelihood) data recalculated using the most recent age data pulled from PacFIN and WCGOP, to account for age doubling in 2017.

Fleet 6. Oregon Recreational:

- CAAL data sample sizes and proportions were doubled so numbers from 1979 - 2017 were divided by two. 
- We included 2015 unsexed ages. 
- We also reassigned the aging error for this fleet for the correct years. The ODFW data representative confirmed that all fish from 1979-2002 were aged by WDFW (ageing error 1), and fish from 2009-2016 were aged by the NWFSC (ageing error 2). No new ages since 2016 were provided. Marginal data were then recalculated from the updated CAAL so that the ageing error labels and number of samples matched.

Fleet 7. Washington Recreational:

- All age data from 1998 to 2024 were replaced with the most recent data provided in RecFIN, following the recommendation of the WDFW representative. CAAL and the marginal age data were calculated using this data.

### Indices of Abundance

Two fishery-dependent indices of abundance were updated with new data and up-to-date methodology. These are detailed below. Otherwise, indices of abundances are unchanged from the previous assessment; please refer to the most recent benchmark assessment [@gertseva_stock_2017] for additional information. 

#### Oregon Onboard Observer CPUE, 2001 – 2024 - 

The Oregon Onboard Observer (now Ocean Recreational Fisheries Survey, or ORFS) index was updated from the previous Yelloweye Rockfish assessment, and updated drift-level catch-per-unit-effort data was obtained from ODFW through the end of 2024. The database contains information on catch by species (number of retained and released fish), effort (angler hours), sample depth, and bag limits and other relevant regulations [@monk_documentation_2013].  

The unfiltered data set contained 18,410 drifts. Multiple standardized filters are applied to remove outliers and data unsuitable for an index. These filters are very similar to filters applied in 2017 and include drifts without data needed for CPUE information, long drifts (above 95th percentile), drifts in deeper waters (more than 64fm, 99th percentile), drifts that were targeting primarily mid-water species, and drifts outside of the legal fishing depth (with a five fm buffer). Additionally, years with extremely low sample sizes (<50) were excluded. Finally, drifts on charters from Port Orford were removed due to small sample sizes. The final filtered data set included 6,839 trips with a 6.1% encounter rate for Yelloweye Rockfish [@tbl-yelloweye_percent_pos_ORFS]. 

Covariates evaluated included year, month, port, the open depths to fishing (all depths or inside 20/30/40fm), and a five fm-binned depth of drift covariate. This is in contrast to the 2017 index, which was only able to evaluate a year covariate. The covariates listed above are standard to evaluate for this index in other assessments. Negative binomial models were fit using sdmTMB (version 0.6.0; @Anderson_2024_SRP) to the drift-level data (catch with a log offset for adjusted angler hours). A model without the open fishing depths or month was selected as the best fit model by AIC [@tbl-yelloweye_model_selection_ORFS]. Acceptable diagnostics for the model were achieved, as evidenced by passing the sanity function in sdmTMB (@fig-orfs_qqplot). The index of abundance is shown in @fig-ORFS_index. A comparison to the ORFS index used in the previous assessment indicates that despite the change in modeling approach and the covariates included, most years overlap between the two indices and similar trends are observed [@fig-ORFS_comp]. The updated index has reduced within-year variance and a lack of extreme swings in the standardized index value (e.g. 2013) relative to the index from 2017.

#### Oregon ORBS Dockside (release only) CPUE, 2004-2024

The Ocean Recreational Boat Survey (ORBS) dockside index for Oregon was updated for this assessment. CPUE, expressed in terms of fish per angler-hour, was calculated by multiplying the number of anglers and the total trip time, minus the boat type-specific travel time. The database contains information on released fish by species (number of angler-reported released fish), effort (angler hours), sample location (port where data were collected), date, bag limits and other relevant regulations, boat type (charter or private), and trip type (e.g., bottom associated fish). 

The unfiltered data set contained 504,128 trips from 2001 - 2024. Since the previous Yelloweye assessment, multiple data filters have been standardized, which are very similar to the 2017 assessment, and are applied to ORBS trip-level data to remove outliers and data unsuitable for an index. For this index, the time period was restricted to years when retention of Yelloweye Rockfish was prohibited, which began on January 1, 2004. There were two differences in the filtering in this updated index. First, the previous index began in 2005, which was determined to be an error in the timing of the implementation of prohibited status for Yelloweye. Given that prohibition was in effect on January 1, the year 2004 is included in this updated index. The second difference in filtering is the elimination of the Stephens-MacCall filter in the updated index. This filter has not been used for several assessment cycles, based on a recommendation from NWFSC staff (pers. comm. A. Whitman, ODFW). The final dataset included 133,039 trips from 2004 – 2024 with an overall encounter rate of 7.4% [@tbl-yelloweye_percent_pos_ORBS].

Covariates evaluated included year, month, port, the open depths to fishing (all depths or inside 20/30/40 fm), and boat type. These are the same covariates evaluated in the 2017 ORBS index, apart from the open depths of the fishery. The final model in 2017 included boat type, port and year. Negative binomial models were fit in sdmTMB (Version 0.6.0) to the trip-level data (catch with a log offset for adjusted angler hours). The final model selected includes year, month, port, boat type and open fishery depths, which was the best fit model by AIC in this series [@tbl-yelloweye_model_selection_ORBS]. Acceptable diagnostics for the model were achieved, as evidenced by passing the sanity function in sdmTMB.(@fig-orbs_qq). The index of abundance in shown in @fig-ORBS_index. ODFW no longer maintains the deltaGLM code that was used to develop the 2017 index and so the index was updated to use the currently accepted modeling approach for PFMC groundfish assessments (sdmTMB, version 0.6.0; @Anderson_2024_SRP). To bridge this change, the 2017 model index structure was applied to the current dataset using sdmTMB and compared to the deltaGLM index used in the 2017 assessment and the current recommended updated index in @fig-ORBS_comp. There are some differences observed in 2005 – 2009 between the deltaGLM index and the two sdmTMB indices; however, this appears to be largely driven by the updated modeling approach.

## Fishery-Independent Data

Two sources of fishery-independent data were updated: the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey and the IPHC Longline survey. 

### West Coast Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS)

The WCGBTS survey methods are most recently described in detail in @keller2017northwest. Geostatistical models of biomass density were fit to survey data from the WCGBTS using \gls{tmb} [@kristensen_tmb:_2016] via the \gls{sdmtmb} R package [@Anderson_2024_SRP] as configured within the [indexwc](https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/indexwc) R package [@Johnson_indexwc]. These models can account for latent spatial factors with a constant spatial Gaussian random field and spatiotemporal deviations to evolve as a random walk Guassian random field [@thorson_geostatistical_2015]. Delta-gamma and delta-lognormal distributions were investigated. Results are only shown for the model that led to the best model diagnostics, defined as similar distributions of theoretical normal quantiles and model quantiles (@fig-wcgbts_qq), high precision, lack of extreme predictions, and low \gls{aic}. Estimates of biomass from this best model were predicted using a grid based on available survey locations.

The final model used a delta model with a lognormal distribution for the catch-rate component. A logit-link was used for encounter probability and a log-link for positive catch rates. The response variable was catch (mt) with an offset of area swept (km^2^) to account for differences in effort. Fixed effects were estimated for each year and pass. The index was estimated for the area north of $42^{\circ}10'$ (Oregon and Washington) to be consistent with the previous assessment. The data were truncated to depths shallower than 325 m prior to modeling given that there were zero positive encounters in depths deeper than 325 m. The prediction grid was also truncated to only include available survey locations in depths between 55--325 m to limit extrapolating beyond the data and edge effects. Spatial variation was included in the encounter probability and the positive catch rate model. Spatial variation was approximated using 200 knots, where more knots led to non-estimable standard errors because the positive encounters are too sparse to support the dense spatiotemporal structure. Anisotropy was not estimated.

The biomass estimates produced for this assessment using sdmTMB are comparable to the biomass estimates produced in the previous benchmark assessment (@fig-wcgbtsindexcomparison). The index is relatively flat with a peak in 2014, but variation is high throughout the time series (@fig-wcgbtsindex).

### IPHC Setline Survey

The IPHC has conducted an annual longline survey for Pacific halibut off the coast of Oregon and Washington (IPHC area “2A”) since 1997 (no surveys were performed in 1998 or 2000). Beginning in 1999, this has been a fixed station design, with roughly 1,800 hooks deployed at each of 84 locations. Before 1999, station locations were not fixed, and, therefore, those years are not used in the index. Rockfish bycatch, mainly yelloweye, was recorded during this survey, although values for 1999 and 2001 are estimates based on subsampling the first 20 hooks of each 100-hook skate. The gear used to conduct this survey, while designed specifically to efficiently sample Pacific halibut, is similar to that used in some earlier line fisheries that targeted adult Yelloweye Rockfish. Some variability in exact sampling location is unavoidable, and leeway is given in the IPHC methods to center the set on the target coordinates but to allow wind and currents to dictate the actual direction in which the gear is deployed. This can result in different habitats accessed at each fixed location among years. The number of skates used can also differ from year to year; skates hauled (i.e., 100 hooks/skate) are thus used as the unit of effort for all years. This has been the standard effort used in past Yelloweye Rockfish stock assessments. 

New to this assessment is the consideration of eight additional survey stations (1527 to 1534) conducted in a collaborative effort between IPHC and WDFW from 2007-2009, 2013-2019 and 2021-2023. These stations are arranged around IPHC station 1082 (one of the more notable stations to encounter Yelloweye Rockfish). Only the summer months are considered here to match the time of year sampled by the IPHC survey. Survey sets at the WDFW stations used three skates with 100 hooks each for most years, except for 2021 - 2023, where a total of four skates were used. Like the IPHC survey, effort was standardized to 100 hooks/skate. These stations were integrated into the IPHC stations when calculating the index of abundance. The full survey used in this assessment combined all stations in Oregon and Washington into a single index. Data were first filtered to remove all depths with few or no encounters, and then we excluded stations that rarely encountered Yelloweye Rockfish (averaging less than one encounter a year). This left a total of 11 stations for analysis. Both filtering levels increased the percentage of encounters from an initial 11% to 80%. 

A log-normal generalized linear model with a log link in the sdmTMB R package [@Anderson_2024_SRP] was used to standardize the CPUE. Model selection using the Akaike Information Criteria for small samples (AICc) was conducted to select which variables were included in the model. The final model included year, station, and depth as explanatory variables. Diagnostic tools to ensure the model fit was satisfactory included checking whether the hessian matrix is positive definite, the presence of extreme eigenvalues, and if the non-linear minimizer suggests convergence. These diagnostics were conducted with the sanity function in the sdmTMB package. The updated index is compared to the index used in 2017 in @fig-IPHC_comparison. 

### Fishery-Independent Length and Age Compositions

Updated length and age composition data were available for the two updated fishery-independent surveys. Compositional data from 2017 through 2024 were updated for WCGBTS were obtained using functions from the [indexwc](https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/indexwc) R package [@Johnson_indexwc]. The IPHC survey compositional data were provided by WDFW. 

A summary of sampling efforts (number of hauls and number of individual fish) in all surveys is provided in **Table X** and **Table X**. Updated year-specific length frequency distributions generated for each survey are shown in @fig-NWFSC_lencomps and @fig-IPHC_lencomps, respectively. Updated year-specific CAAL frequencies for each survey are shown in @fig-NWFSC_agecomps1 and @fig-NWFSC_agecomps2 for the WCGBTS and @fig-IPHC_agecomps1 and @fig-IPHC_agecomps2. 

## Biological Parameters and Data

The approach to natural mortality, maturity and fecundity were unchanged from the previous assessment [@gertseva_stock_2017]. All of these biological parameters used in the assessment were estimated outside the model or obtained from literature. Therefore, uncertainty reported for the stock assessment results does not include any uncertainty in these quantities (however, some were investigated via sensitivity analyses described later in this report). The parameters for the length-weight relationship were updated to include the most recent data from 2017 - 2024. The parameters derived from this analysis were as follows: ⍺ = 7.183309·10-6, and β  = 3.244801 (@fig-LWrel). Aging error matrices were unchanged.
