## Base Model Results
**We havent updated this section yet since Kiva looked at it, we definitely need more time for this section and to cut out the fluff**

### Parameter Estimates

The list of the all the parameters used in the assessment model and their values (either fixed or estimated) is provided in @tbl-pars. The growth parameters estimated within the model are reasonable, commensurate with inspection of the raw data and consistent with what we know about the species, a long-lived rockfish with relatively slow growth and large asymptotic sizes. These parameters are relatively precisely estimated in terms of the asymptotic standard error estimates. @fig-growth shows the estimated growth curve. Spawning output-at-length is shown in @fig-spoutlen. Spawning output in the assessment is expressed in millions of eggs.

Estimated stock-recruit function for the assessment model is shown in @fig-SR_curve. Estimated recruitment deviations are shown @fig-recdevs_err. Recruitment of Yelloweye Rockfish was estimated to be quite variable over time, with the most recent years experiencing slightly lower than average recruitment after periods of low and high recruitment during the late 1980s to the early 200s, and late 2000s to late 2010s, respectively. Reflecting these variable recruitment patterns, the estimated stock-recruit function predicts a relatively wide range of cohort sizes over the observed range of spawning biomass. The model output recruitment variance (RMSE = 0.48) is consistent with the fixed input recruitment variance (ÔÅ≥R = 0.5).

Length-based selectivity curves estimated in the assessment are shown for all fleets together in @fig-selex_allfleets. Estimated selectivity curves for the fishing fleets indicate that the recreational fleets access somewhat smaller fish than the commercial fisheries. This pattern is most pronounced in Oregon, and also as expected, since recent charter fishing selectivity has shifted shoreward where there is a higher density of smaller fish. Addition of the charter vessel length data did not appreciably change the estimate for the California recreational selectivity pattern and so the selectivity for the two series was not separated. All fleets for which curves were allowed to be dome-shaped (commercial trawl and non-trawl fleets) were estimated to be asymptotic. Estimated selectivity curves for the IPHC survey indicate a selection of the largest Yelloweye available, and select the least amount of smaller Yelloweye Rockfish (@fig-sel12). The NWFSC trawl survey selected far more smaller Yelloweye among all surveys (@fig-sel11). That the triennial survey selectivity was shifted to the largest fish but also selected some very small fish is likely an artifact of the very noisy composition data from that survey (@fig-sel10). 

### Fits to the Data

<!-- Residual analysis for the base-run configuration, e.g., residual plots, time series plots of observed and predicted values, etc.   -->

Model fits to the fishery CPUE and survey indices are presented in @fig-indexfit3 through @fig-indexfit12. The base model predicted a decreasing trend in the triennial survey between 1980 and 2004 (@fig-indexfit10) and a slightly increasing trend for the NWFSC trawl survey between 2003 and 2024 (@fig-indexfit11). The model predicted a relatively flat trend through the \gls{iphc} survey index despite the upward trend seen in the last three years as of this update (@fig-indexfit12). The triennial survey index indicated a population decrease in 1992 and lower estimates (compared with pre-1992) persisted through the end of the index time series. This decrease in the abundance index coincided with decrease in number of biological samples collected from this survey. No changes have been implemented to the triennial survey between 1989 and 1992. In 1995, the survey timing slightly shifted from early fall to mid-summer, approximately a month earlier that previous surveys. This shift in timing, however, seems unlikely to impact our understanding of Yelloweye Rockfish abundance trends during that period, given the sedentary life history of the species. Additionally, the change in the index trend was observed before the slight shift in survey timing. The California \gls{mrfss} recreational CPUE index tracked the decline in observations through the 1990s (@fig-indexfit3), and a slight increase in abundance was predicted in the Oregon \gls{mrfss}/\gls{orbs} recreational index during the 2000s (@fig-indexfit6). The Oregon recreational observer index showed a small and very uncertain increasing trend in the 2000s (@fig-indexfit9). The California \gls{cpfv} charter series index indicated a relatively flat trajectory prior to 1992 with a drop in stock abundance from 1992 on (@fig-indexfit8). The model predicted a decreasing trend for the Washington Recreational index despite the relatively large variances on many of the observations, which does not match the relative stability of the index from 1982 to the early 2000s (@fig-indexfit7).

The model fitted length data aggregated across years reasonably well for all fleets (@fig-agglencomps). Pearson residuals for the fits by fleet and year are shown in @fig-pearsonlenfit1 and @fig-pearsonlenfit2. The length data are very sparse in many years and the quality of fit varies among years and fleets, reflecting the differences in the quantity and quality of the data. However, neither length composition data nor the Pearson residuals, which reflect the noise in the data both within and among years, exhibit obvious patterns for any fleet. The data for fishing fleets are particularly poor after 2002 after retention of Yelloweye Rockfish was prohibited in most fleets and limited in trawl fleets. Input sample sizes for length composition data were tuned down using the Francis data weighting method (@tbl-compweight).

### Population Trajectory

The estimated time series of spawning output for the entire stock and by area are shown in @fig-spout_combined and @fig-spout_area, respectively. Spawning output relative to SB0 for the entire stock and by area are shown in @fig-status_combined and @fig-status_area. Total biomass, summary biomass and recruitment are shown in @fig-totalbio, @fig-summbio and @fig-tsrecuits, respectively. Trends in total and summary biomass, absolute and relative spawning output track one another very closely. The spawning output of Yelloweye Rockfish started to decline in the 1940s during World War II, but are estimated to have been lightly exploited until the mid-1970s when catches increased and a rapid decline in biomass and spawning output began. The combined relative spawning output reached a minimum of 16% of unexploited levels in 2000 (@fig-spout_combined). Yelloweye Rockfish spawning output and relative status is estimated to have been gradually increasing since that time, in response to large reductions in harvest. However, the aggregate spawning output estimates do not convey the spatial heterogeneity included via the area-specific dynamics. Relative spawning output has differed between the two areas modelled in the assessment, with the California resource estimated to have a lower unfished equilibrium spawning output and estimated to be more depleted in 2025 than the Oregon and Washington resource (@fig-status_area). 

Recruitment appears to be relatively dynamic over time, with several elevated peaks over time estimated in the age-0 recruits (@fig-tsrecuits). An initial peak in the mid-1940s is followed by a two periods of elevated recruitment in the 1970s and early 1980s and another period centered around the 2010s. This trend is consistent with the previous assessment, apart from the most recent elevated time period, which estimated a sole peak in 2001 and several other peaks of smaller magnitude starting in 2005. Recruits for this assessment appear to have extended and increased this more recent time period starting in 2005, with a peak in 2008 and 2013 and shifts the peak in 2001 to 2002. Recruitment in the late 2010s was estimated to be lower, but a more recent increase is seen starting in 2020.
