# Management 

## Reference Points

<!-- 1. Unfished spawning stock biomass, summary age biomass, and recruitment, along with unfished spawning stock output.  -->
<!-- 2. Reference points based on B40% for rockfish and round fish and on B25% for flatfish (spawning biomass and/or output, SPR, exploitation rate, equilibrium yield).  -->
<!-- 3.   Reference points based on default SPR proxy (spawning biomass and/or output, SPR, exploitation rate, equilibrium yield).  -->
<!-- 4. Reference points based on MSY (if estimated) (spawning biomass and/or output, SPR, exploitation rate, equilibrium yield).  -->
<!-- 5. Equilibrium yield curve showing various BMSY proxies.   -->

This assessment estimates that the stock of Yelloweye Rockfish off the continental U.S. Pacific Coast is currently at `r round(mod_out$derived_quants$Value[which(mod_out$derived_quants$Label=="Bratio_2025")], 3)*100`% of its unexploited level. This is above the overfished threshold of SO25%, and slightly above the management target of SO40% of unfished spawning output. Both areas (California and Oregon-Washington) are above the overfished level of 25%. The assessment estimates that the coastwide spawning output of Yelloweye Rockfish dropped below the SO40% target for the first time in 1986 and below the overfished SO25% threshold in 1993, as a result of intense fishing by commercial and recreational fleets. It continued to decline and reached 15.6% of its unfished output in 2000 (@tbl-ts). The stock was declared overfished in 2002. Since then, the spawning output has slowly increased due to management regulations implemented to foster stock rebuilding.

Reference points for the base model are summarized in @tbl-ref-points-es-2. Unfished spawning stock output for Yelloweye Rockfish was estimated to be `r round(mod_out$derived_quants$Value[which(mod_out$derived_quants$Label=="SSB_Virgin")], 3)` million eggs (95% confidence interval: 1,048.1 - 1,331.9 million eggs). The stock is declared overfished if the current spawning output is estimated to be below the \gls{msst} of 25% of unfished level (SO25%). The management target for Yelloweye Rockfish is defined as 40% of the unfished spawning output (SO40%), which is estimated by the model to be 476 million eggs (95% confidence interval: 419 - 533 million eggs), which corresponds to an exploitation rate of 0.026. This harvest rate provides an equilibrium yield of 122 mt at SO40% (95% confidence interval: 108 - 137 mt). The model estimate of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is 128 mt (95% confidence interval: 113 - 143 mt). The estimated spawning stock output at MSY is 343 million eggs (95% confidence interval: 303-384 million eggs). The exploitation rate corresponding to the estimated SPRMSY is 0.037.

This assessment estimates that the 2024 SPR is `r (1-(round(mod_out$derived_quants$Value[which(mod_out$derived_quants$Label=="SPRratio_2024")], 3)))*100`% (@fig-time-spr). The SPR used for setting the OFL is 50%, while the SPR-based management fishing mortality target specified in the current rebuilding plan and used to determine the \gls{acl} is 76% (when the SPR is greater than this value, the exploitation is below the target). Relative exploitation rates (calculated as catch/biomass of age-8 and older fish) are estimated to have been below 1% during the last decade. This assessment estimates that Yelloweye Rockfish was fished beyond the relative SPR ratio (calculated as 1-SPR/1-SPRTarget=0.5) between 1977 and 2000. The equilibrium yield curve is shown in @fig-eq-yield.

## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

The base model estimate for 2025 spawning depletion is `r round(mod_out$derived_quants$Value[which(mod_out$derived_quants$Label=="Bratio_2025")], 3)*100`% (@tbl-projections). The primary axis of uncertainty about this estimate used in the decision table was based on natural mortality. Natural mortality in the assessment model is fixed at the median of the Hamel prior (0.044 y-1), estimated using the maximum age of 123 years. The natural mortality value for the high state of nature was calculated to correspond to 97 years of age, which was the 99th percentile of the age data available for the 2017 assessment (@gertseva_stock_2017); this value was 0.056 y-1. The natural mortality value for low state of nature was calculated to correspond to 147 years of age, which is the maximum age reported for the Yelloweye Rockfish at the time of the 2017 assessment (@gertseva_stock_2017); this value was 0.037 y-1.

Twelve-year forecasts for each state of nature were calculated (@tbl-es-decision-2).

## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty

The model estimate of the log-scale standard deviation of the 2025 spawning output is `r mod_out$Pstar_sigma |> round(4)`. The model estimate of the log-scale standard deviation of the 2025 \gls{ofl} is `r mod_out$OFL_sigma |> round(4)`. Each of these are likely underestimates of overall uncertainty due to the necessity to fix several key population dynamics parameters (e.g. steepness and recruitment variance) and also because there is no explicit incorporation of model structural uncertainty (although see the decision table for alternative states of nature).

## Regional management considerations

Yelloweye Rockfish is modeled in two areas (California and Oregon-Washington) in this assessment. Current population status does differ by area and may be valuable information for making management and allocation decisions (@fig-status-area).

## Research and Data Needs

<!-- 1. Describe progress on Research and Data Needs items identified in the most recent previous stock assessment document and associated STAR panel report.  -->
<!-- 2. Describe new research and data needs and specify their priority (high, medium, low).  -->

Please refer to the 2017 benchmark assessment for a detailed list of research and data needs for Yelloweye Rockfish (@gertseva_stock_2017). In addition to those, the following research and recommendations could improve the ability of future stock assessments to determine the status and productivity of the Yelloweye Rockfish population:

-	Continue refining the ORFS index analysis and ultimately use either the ORBS or ORFS index to describe the CPUE trends in the Oregon recreational fishery after 2000.
-	Expand the IPHC age composition bins to an older maximum age for the IPHC age composition data to spread out the distribution of length data in the oldest age bins for conditional age-at-length.
