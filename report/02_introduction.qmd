# Introduction

Yelloweye Rockfish (**Sebastes ruberrimus**) are found from the Gulf of Alaska to northern Baja California in Mexico across the northeastern Pacific Ocean (@hart_pacific_1973, @love_rockfishes_2002). Their core distribution is from southeast Alaska to central California on the west coast of the United States (@love_rockfishes_2002). Yelloweye Rockfish in Puget Sound are considered isolated from the coastal waters population (Stewart et al. 2009) and have been listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act since 2010 (Drake et al. 2010). 

Yelloweye Rockfish are strongly assocaited with rocky bottom habtiat, particularly areas of high relief (@love_rockfishes_2002), and are widely considered to be sedentary after settlement (Coombs 1979, DeMott 1983). However, new tagging studies suggest that Yelloweye Rockfish exhibit larger scale movement patterns more commonly than preivously considered (Hannah and Rankin 2011, Rasmusson et al. 2025).

## Management performance

<!-- Management performance, including a table or tables comparing Overfishing Limit (OFL), Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC), Annual Catch Limit (ACL), landings, and catch (i.e., landings plus discard) for each area and year. Groundfish assessments that estimate dead discarded catch must include a disclaimer noting that total mortality estimates from the WCGOP and from the stock assessment may differ due to the use of different methods. Investigation into how these methods differ is beyond the scope of a benchmark assessment. The rationale for modeling discard mortality can also be provided. This should be included in all update assessments.  -->
